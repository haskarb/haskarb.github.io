Hello, I'm a Time Series Researcher at the Huawei Ireland Research Centre, Dublin. I completed my PhD from the [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie) focusing on developing scalable methods for Multivariate Time Series Classification under the guidance of [Prof. Georgiana Ifrim](https://people.ucd.ie/georgiana.ifrim). During my doctoral studies, I received support from the Vistamilk SFI Research Centre, which allowed me to dive deeper into the practical applications of my research.

During my PhD studies, I had the opportunity to intern at AWS, work with the Gluon TS team, and contribute to open-source libraries like Sktime and Aeon-toolkit, to further my experience in time-series analysis.

My prior educational experience includes a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Hyderabad](https://scis.uohyd.ac.in/), where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Vadlamani Ravi](https://www.idrbt.ac.in/dr-v-ravi/). My master's thesis focused on applying hybrid deep learning to sentiment analysis, which allowed me to strengthen my skills in the field of AI.

Prior my PhD, I worked in applied machine learning ION Energy and HSBC in India.
