I am a PhD candidate at the [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie), conducting research on developing Scalable Classifiers for the Multivariate Time Series data advised by [Prof. Georgiana Ifrim](https://people.ucd.ie/georgiana.ifrim) at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.ucd.ie/cs/). My work is supported by the Vistamilk SFI Research Centre, where I delve deeper into the applications of my research.

During my PhD studies, I had the opportunity to intern at AWS, work with the GluonTS team, and contribute to open-source libraries like Sktime and Aeon-toolkit, to further my experience in time-series analysis.

My prior educational experience includes a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Hyderabad](https://scis.uohyd.ac.in/), where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Vadlamani Ravi](https://www.idrbt.ac.in/dr-v-ravi/). My master's thesis focused on applying hybrid deep learning to sentiment analysis, which allowed me to strengthen my skills in the field of AI.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I honed my practical skills in the field of machine learning through my tenure at ION Energy and HSBC in India.
